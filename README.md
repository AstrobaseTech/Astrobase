## Stability

This project is currently in a pre-release state as indicated by the `<1.0.0` version number. During this time, breaking changes will be more common.

- Breaking changes will occur on **minor** version numbers, i.e. the `x` of `v0.x.y`, where possible.

- Deprecation warnings will be added to the latest **patch** version prior to the minor version where possible.

- It is recommended to upgrade **one minor version at a time**. This way you can use tooling like [ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [`eslint-plugin-deprecation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-deprecation) to help address deprecation issues.

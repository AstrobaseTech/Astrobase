/**
 * Implements functionality related to cryptographic hash functions and serializing hash digests.
 * Hashing algorithms are identifiable via an integer identifier, for instance `0` is the identifier
 * for SHA-256. Implementations for different algorithms may be provided in the Instance config.
 * Hashes are typically prefixed with the hashing algorithm identifier when serialized, including
 * when they form part of an immutable content identifier.

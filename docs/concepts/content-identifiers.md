Content Identifiers are keys used to identify and look up content. A Content Identifier is made up of a prefix and a value. The prefix is a short human readable string which indicates what type of Content Identifier it is and therefore what rules the content should follow. The value varies depending on the type of Content Identifier. Content Identifiers use bech32 encoding to represent them as a string.
